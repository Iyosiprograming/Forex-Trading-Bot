Absolutely! Here’s a clear step-by-step **guideline** to build your v1 hybrid price-action + AI trading bot yourself. This will help you organize and implement it efficiently:

---

# Step-by-Step Guide to Build Your v1 Trading Bot

### 1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

* Choose your stack: Node.js + TypeScript or Python (based on your preference).
* Initialize a new project with a proper folder structure (e.g., `/data`, `/src`, `/api`, `/utils`).
* Set up version control with Git to track progress and changes.

---

### 2. **Data Collection**

* Connect to a data source (broker API or a reliable price data provider) to fetch real-time XAUUSD candlestick data on your chosen timeframes (start with 5min).
* Store recent candles in-memory or a simple local database for quick access.

---

### 3. **Implement Simple Price Action Pre-Filter**

* Write functions to:

  * Detect basic price action patterns (e.g., pin bars, engulfing candles).
  * Identify nearby support and resistance levels (use recent swing highs/lows).
* Combine these rules to flag “candidate signals” when price action setups occur near key levels.
* Test this module against historical data to ensure it works correctly.

---

### 4. **Integrate with DeepSeek AI**

* Research and understand DeepSeek’s API (or whichever AI service you plan to use).
* Build an API client module to send candidate signals (structured JSON data) and receive back trade recommendations.
* Handle response data: parse signal type (BUY/SELL/NO-TRADE), suggested SL, TP, and confidence scores if provided.

---

### 5. **Trade Execution Module**

* Connect to your broker’s API with demo credentials.
* Write functions to:

  * Place market or limit orders with SL and TP.
  * Check order status and handle errors gracefully.
* Add safeguards to avoid duplicate orders or overexposure.

---

### 6. **Orchestrate the Bot Workflow**

* Build a main loop or event-driven system to:

  * Fetch latest price candles.
  * Run pre-filter on the data.
  * For each candidate signal, call DeepSeek AI.
  * Based on AI response, place trades.
* Include logging for each step: data fetched, signals generated, AI decisions, and orders placed.

---

### 7. **Testing & Monitoring**

* Start with paper trading (demo account) to avoid real money risk.
* Log all decisions and trades to a file or database.
* Analyze logs regularly to evaluate bot performance.
* Tune pre-filter thresholds and trade parameters based on outcomes.

---

### 8. **Plan for Improvements**

* After stable v1 operation, consider adding:

  * Multi-timeframe confirmation (e.g., combine 15min and 5min signals).
  * Risk management rules (max drawdown, position sizing).
  * Alerting system (e.g., notify you on trade execution or failures).
  * Dashboard/UI to visualize trades and signals.

---

# Quick Tips

* Start small and simple; focus on getting each piece working well.
* Use modular design so you can replace or upgrade components (like switching AI models) easily.
* Keep an eye on latency — you want the bot to react quickly to price changes.
* Always back up your code and data before making big changes.
