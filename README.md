To build your **Forex trading bot** with the logic you shared (EMA crossover strategy), here's a **clear breakdown** of what you should know, how to structure the project, and what tools you'll need.

---

## 🧠 What You Should Know First

1. **Basic Forex Concepts**

   * Currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD)
   * Lot sizes (micro, mini, standard)
   * Leverage, margin, stop-loss, and take-profit

2. **Trading Platform API**

   * Use **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)** or **MetaTrader 4 (MT4)** with Python via `MetaTrader5` or `MetaTrader4 wrapper`
   * Alternatively: Use **cTrader API**, **OANDA**, or **Interactive Brokers**

3. **Python Skills**

   * Working with APIs
   * EMA calculation using `pandas`
   * Async programming (to monitor signals in real-time)
   * File I/O to log trades

4. **Bot Behavior**

   * EMA crossover logic
   * Managing open positions
   * Avoiding duplicate trades
   * Managing trade lifecycle

├── main.py                   # Entry point: initializes the bot and user inputs
├── config.py                 # Configurable settings: lots, pairs, timeframes
├── strategy.py               # Contains EMA crossover logic
├── trade_manager.py          # Handles trade execution and close logic
├── broker_api.py             # Interface to MT5 / cTrader / OANDA
├── logger.py                 # Logs all trades to CSV
├── utils.py                  # Helper functions (EMA calculation, validation, etc.)
├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
└── README.md                 # How to use the bot

## ⚙️ Requirements (`requirements.txt`)

```txt
pandas
MetaTrader5
python-dotenv
```

## 🧩 How Components Work Together

### ✅ `main.py`

* Ask user: currency pair, timeframe, lot size
* Starts trading loop

### ✅ `strategy.py`

* Reads historical candles
* Calculates EMA(10) and EMA(20)
* Detects crossover/crossunder signals

### ✅ `trade_manager.py`

* If new signal:

  * Closes opposite trade if open
  * Opens new trade (buy/sell)
  * Logs trade

### ✅ `broker_api.py`

* Connects to MetaTrader 5 (or your broker)
* Gets price data
* Places/cancels trades

### ✅ `logger.py`

* Appends trade details into CSV file:

```csv
timestamp,pair,action,lot,price,signal
2025-08-02 14:33,EURUSD,buy,0.1,1.10452,buy-signal
```

---

## 🚀 Sample Flow (Simplified)

```python
# main.py
from strategy import check_signal
from trade_manager import execute_trade
from broker_api import connect, get_data
from config import ask_user_inputs

def run_bot():
    config = ask_user_inputs()
    connect()
    
    while True:
        data = get_data(config.pair, config.timeframe)
        signal = check_signal(data)
        execute_trade(signal, config)
        time.sleep(30)  # Wait before checking again

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_bot()
```

---

## 👨‍🔧 What You'll Need to Implement

1. **Setup your broker account (MT5 recommended)**

   * Enable algorithmic trading
   * Run MetaTrader locally
2. **Connect MT5 with Python**

   * Install `MetaTrader5` package
   * Import historical data for analysis
3. **Backtest first**

   * Before live trading, test logic on historical data
4. **Run on VPS**

   * Keep the bot online 24/5

## 🧪 Next Steps for You

* [ ] Set up MetaTrader 5 and test with demo account
* [ ] Build each file one-by-one
* [ ] Add trade recording
* [ ] Add logging for debugging

If you want, I can now generate each file (starting with `config.py` and `main.py`) or help you build this step-by-step. Want to begin with file #1?
